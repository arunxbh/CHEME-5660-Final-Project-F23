# CHEME-5660-Hybrid-Investment-Project-F23

This is the final project for CHEME 5660 in Julia. The goal of this project is to explore strategies for the modeling, selection, and hedging of equity portfolios, with a special focus on the tech sector. Utilizing principles of financial engineering, the project facilitates informed portfolio management decisions based on historical trends and real market data.

## Features

This project explores three main things:

1. **Equity Modeling via Geometric Brownian Motion**: Leverage GBM to simulate and forecast the price trajectory of select equities. Identify and select assets with a positive or neutral drift, signifying a favorable bullish portfolio.

2. **Dynamic Online Portfolio Reallocation**: Engage in proactive portfolio management by reallocating tech equities holdings daily. The objective is to maximize Year-To-Date (YTD) returns in comparison to a set benchmark which is the $SPY index, using the latest market data and risk metrics to inform allocation decisions.

3. **Covered Call Strategy for Volatility Hedge**: Implement a covered call strategy on a subset of the reallocation portfolio to hedge against market volatility. The strategy involves calculating the probability of options being exercised based on historical market data, enabling a more defensive portfolio stance against volatile tech equities.
